# random_tiles
Archive. Short program for randomising terrain in FOnline map. Map files in FOnline contain a list of x,y co-ordinates and the 2.5D sprite to be placed at that location. For a giving terrain type, there were around 10 different sprites. Rather than paint terrain in manually, this program took the terrain sprite prefixes and suffixes, and wrote a text file giving them a random distribution.
